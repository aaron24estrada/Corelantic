# Status & Handoff

Last updated 2026-07-10. A snapshot of where the build is, what's verified, what's blocked, and what to do next — written so a fresh session can continue without prior context. Decisions and their rationale live in [`decisions.md`](./decisions.md); the real KRW schema lives in [`data-model.md`](./data-model.md); this is the "where are we / what next" view.

## The headline

**The backend is done for everything we can read.** The API serves **25 real metrics** over KRW's live Azure SQL (`gold_tspot`) through `POST /api/v1/query`, and the same registry runs against a seeded fixture that reproduces the source's numbers. Every metric on KRW's Executive Summary is reachable **except Spend and ROAS** — and that gap is an access grant, not code.

It was 30 until week-over-week and year-to-date stopped being *metrics*. `leads_wow_pct`, `leads_mom_pct`, `calls_wow_pct`, `leads_ytd` and `calls_mtd` are gone, replaced by `compare` and `accumulate` on the intent. That is a gain, not a loss: a comparison metric could only wrap a bare measure, so a week-over-week **voucher rate** or **revenue** was unrepresentable. Now **all 25** metrics can be compared and **17** can be accumulated, and one request returns the series, the value and the delta — a KPI tile used to need two.

## Built so far

- **Docs** — the MVP spec set ([spec](./spec.md), [architecture](./architecture.md), [concepts](./concepts.md), [data & semantic layer](./data-and-semantic-layer.md), [NL pipeline](./nlq-pipeline.md), [decisions](./decisions.md), [data-model](./data-model.md)).
- **Foundation** — `standards/`, `CLAUDE.md`, repo hygiene, pre-commit hooks.
- **`apps/api`** (FastAPI, uv) — the semantic layer and query engine, complete:
  - Four-type registry (entity / dimension / measure / metric), three metric shapes (simple, ratio, derived), plus **registry constants** and **filtered measures**.
  - Query compiler: structured intent → parameterized SQLAlchemy Core. Identifiers come only from the authored registry; values are always bound. **The model never emits SQL we execute.**
  - `POST /api/v1/query` takes an intent and returns a **`ResultSet`**: rows plus the column schema that describes them, plus the intent as it was actually run (relative window resolved to dates).
  - **Capability layer** (`semantic/capability.py`) — one implementation answering "what can this metric be asked" both as the predicate `validate_intent` enforces and as the projection `GET /api/v1/catalog` publishes, so the two cannot drift. A property test asserts a planner obeying the catalog can never be told 422.
  - `GET /api/v1/catalog` — every metric with its groupable dimensions, reachable date dimensions and supported modifiers; every dimension with its members; the closed enums for grain and relative range; and the calendar table saying which resets a grain may use.
  - Every bad intent is a **422** with a stable code and `allowed`: the vocabulary that would have worked. The agent repairs rather than retries.
  - Join graph with **cardinality-aware fan-out rejection**, LEFT OUTER fact→dimension joins, and date dimensions resolvable across a fan-out-free join.
  - Dialect-neutral time intelligence on the **intent** (grain, ranges, `compare`, `accumulate`) with SQLite **and** SQL Server renderings.
  - Two `DataSource` adapters behind one factory: **`azure_sql`** (real, Entra auth) and **`fixture`** (seeded in-memory SQLite).
  - **`ChartSpec`** — the fourth seam (D-6), authored in the API contract so it flows through OpenAPI into the generated TS client, and built by a pure function of `(chart request, resolved intent, ResultSet)`. It carries its data, so `<Chart>` is a dumb adapter and every pivot decision is under pytest.
- **`apps/web`** (Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind v4) — typed API client from the OpenAPI schema, BFF boundary, branded shell, and now **charts**: one `<Chart>` over `echarts/core`, the theme applied in exactly one place (`lib/chart/echarts-option.ts`), shared `ErrorState` / `EmptyState` / `ChartSkeleton`, and an eight-hue categorical palette. `/dashboard` draws a live trend beside the catalog. KPI tiles (D4) and the core visuals (D5) are next.

`make check` green: 247 pytest + 22 vitest. `make validate` green: 5 entities, 19 measures, 14 dimensions, 25 metrics, 1 constant across two registry files.

## The API in one page

Four routes. `/health` is open; the rest need the internal secret (`x-internal-api-key`).

**`GET /api/v1/catalog`** — the vocabulary, and what may be asked of it. Read it before composing an intent. Per metric: `groupable_dimensions` (valid for `group_by` *and* `filters`), `date_dimensions`, and `supports: {compare, accumulate}`. Per dimension: `members`, when the value set is closed. Plus `grains`, `relative_ranges`, and `accumulation_resets` — the calendar rule saying which resets each grain may use.

It bounds the **vocabulary**, not the *shape* of a request. Three refusals remain reachable from catalog-only names, because each is a property of the question: `compare` with `accumulate`, grouping by the very date `grain` buckets, and a running total starting mid-period.

**`POST /api/v1/query`** — an intent in, a `ResultSet` out, and a `ChartSpec` too if you ask for one.

```jsonc
// request — `chart` is a sibling of the intent, never a field on it
{
  "intent": {"metric": "voucher_rate", "grain": "week", "compare": {}, "date_range": "last_90_days"},
  "chart": {"type": "line"}          // omit for rows only
}

// response
{
  "result": {
    "columns": [
      {"name": "period",       "role": "period",   "label": "Period"},
      {"name": "voucher_rate", "role": "metric",   "label": "Voucher rate %", "format": "percent"},
      {"name": "previous",     "role": "previous", "label": "Previous voucher rate %", "format": "percent"},
      {"name": "delta",        "role": "delta",    "label": "Change", "format": "percent_point"}
    ],
    "rows": [{"period": "2026-07-06", "voucher_rate": 0.2717, "previous": 0.2558, "delta": 0.0159}],
    "resolved_intent": {"date_range": {"start": "2026-04-12", "end": "2026-07-10"}, "compare": {"kind": "change"}, /* … */}
  },
  "chart": {
    "type": "line", "title": "Voucher rate %", "subtitle": "12 Apr 2026 – 10 Jul 2026",
    "categories": ["2026-07-06"],
    "series": [
      {"name": "Voucher rate %", "data": [0.2717], "role": "primary",    "palette_index": 0, "format": "percent"},
      {"name": "Previous voucher rate %", "data": [0.2558], "role": "comparison", "palette_index": 0, "format": "percent"}
    ]
  }
}
```

`chart` is deliberately **outside** the intent: an intent is a question and is visual-independent, so `resolved_intent` never echoes a chart type back and E2's planner never has to choose a visual in order to ask anything.

Three things that shape the frontend:

- **`columns` describes the rows.** Roles and formats come from the API, so a chart, a table and a narrative all read one description. Never re-derive them from the intent.
- **`resolved_intent` is the request as actually run** — relative window turned into explicit dates, inferred date dimension named, comparison's `kind` decided. A caption can state the window the chart truly covers.
- **`delta` of a percent metric is in points, not percent.** 20% → 24% rose four points. The API picks that from the metric's format and says so via `format: "percent_point"`.

**Every bad intent is a 422**, never a 404 or a 500, with a stable `code`, the `field` at fault, and `allowed` — the vocabulary that *would* have worked:

```json
{"code": "incompatible_dimension", "field": "group_by",
 "detail": "Metric 'voucher_rate' cannot be sliced by dimension 'stage_name': the metric's own measure already filters on that column, so every other group would aggregate to nothing.",
 "allowed": ["channel", "lead_date", "state", "status"]}
```

That `allowed` list is the point: the agent repairs its intent instead of retrying blind (E2), and `ErrorState` names the options instead of saying "failed" (D2).

**Every 422 now wears that one body**, including the ones pydantic raises before a handler runs. FastAPI's own validation error is a *list* of pydantic errors, which was a second shape on the status code that already carried ours — so the client had to narrow `detail` before it could show anything, and `allowed` was not in the generated TypeScript at all. A `RequestValidationError` handler normalises it, and the routes declare `422: ErrorResponse`.

A `ChartSpec` cannot always be drawn from a result, so two more codes exist. Both are chart-request faults, reported against `chart` or `group_by` and never against the intent:

- `unsupported_chart_type` — a `line` with no grain to run along; a `bar` with both a period and a group. `allowed` names the types that would have worked.
- `unpivotable_dimension` — splitting a trend into one series per member requires each member to hold a colour that a filter cannot move (below). `channel` declares nine members and there are eight colours; `state` declares none at all.

**`POST /api/v1/nlq/ask`** — question in, the same `ResultSet` plus a narrative, and a `chart` slot that E3 fills. Blocked on E1.

## Database access (O-1 — resolved)

Read-only access to KRW's warehouse, granted 2026-07-10.

- **Server** `krw-platform-sql.database.windows.net`, database `krw-platform`.
- **Auth** Entra ID, no SQL login. Dev uses device-code (interactive MFA) as `zain.hussain@krwlawyers.com`; the token is packed length-prefixed UTF-16LE and passed to ODBC. Needs `msodbcsql18` + `unixodbc-dev` installed locally.
- **Reachable from** two allow-listed IPs (a home IP and a static VPN IP). Work through the VPN — the home IP can rotate and the failure looks like a login error, not a network one.
- **Readable**: schema **`gold_tspot` only** (9 tables).
- **Deployed auth is unsolved**: a personal MFA account cannot authenticate headlessly. Production needs a **service principal / managed identity** with read-only `gold_tspot`. `azure_sql_auth_mode=service_principal` is already wired; the credential is not provisioned. Not a dev blocker; ask Imran.

## What the data actually is (O-2 — resolved for `gold_tspot`)

KRW is a **legal mass-tort referral practice** (asbestos/mesothelioma), not a generic marketing funnel. Three layers:

1. **Leads** — `cases` (86,973), `geo` (~38% of leads have **no** geo row — the dashboard's "(Blank)" bucket), channel via `source_category`.
2. **Intake funnel** — `stages`, one row per milestone reached: Lead → Voucher (24.2%) → X-Ray → B-Read → Clinic → Bank Complete (14.7%).
3. **Call centre** — `zoom_calls`, `agent_stats` (not on KRW's dashboard at all; pure upside).

Every metric definition was **verified against the live tables**, not inferred. Definitions that look obvious and are wrong are recorded in [`data-model.md`](./data-model.md); the load-bearing ones:

- A call was answered iff it has an **`answer_time`** (`COUNT` skips NULLs). Filtering `call_result = 'answered'` understates the rate ~4× — `connected` is the bigger bucket.
- `duration` is **seconds**, not milliseconds.
- Agent conversion is **pooled** `SUM(converted)/SUM(contacted)` = 4.44%. `agent_stats` is a per-agent-per-week rollup, so averaging its stored `conversion_rate_pct` gives 2.65% — a mean-of-ratios error.
- A `zoom_calls` row is a **call leg**, not a call (92,741 rows, 82,868 distinct `call_id`).
- `cases.Milestone` is *current* state, **not** the funnel. The funnel is `stages`.
- **Revenue is not stored**: Power BI computes it as `vouchers × $6,000`. That fee is a registry constant (`case_fee`), pending Imran's confirmation it's current.

## Blocked — the real critical path

- **Spend + Referrals (#37) — the only thing between us and the full dashboard.** `marketing_budget` (spend → **ROAS**, **Cost per Lead**) and `referral_leads` (cancer type, referral firm, fees) are **not in `gold_tspot`**. The `bronze_marketing`, `bronze_finance`, and `*_lawruler` schemas exist in the same database but this login cannot read them. Both originate as spreadsheets landed into the warehouse, so this is most likely an access grant, not a connector. Owner: **Imran**.
- **Deployed auth** — service principal for headless Azure SQL access (above). Owner: Imran.
- **O-4 — auth.** Reuse Entra vs. Corelantic's own IdP. Owner: you/Dom. Blocks the web login.
- **E1 — Anthropic API key.** Blocks the NL agent (the planner can be built and tested against a fake).
- **O-3 — deploy target** (Azure vs GCP). Parked for Dom; not blocking.

**O-5 is resolved (2026-07-10): Apache ECharts.** We stopped waiting for Imran to confirm his agent's format, because waiting inverted D-6 — `ChartSpec` is a seam *we* own, and a differently-shaped agent output is an adapter at the boundary, not a redesign. D3 and D6 are unblocked; the reasoning is in [`decisions.md`](./decisions.md), D-8.

## Next steps

Unblocked, highest value first:

1. **D4 (#13) + D5 (#14) — mostly assembly now.** The tiles and visuals compose `POST /query` with a `chart` request and hand the spec to `<Chart>`. Two things to know before starting: the KPI-tile count is a product call (below), and D5's funnel and map are new `ChartType`s — extend `ChartSpec` and register the ECharts chart in `components/chart.tsx`; do **not** add a bespoke component. The funnel additionally needs `stage_name` to declare its members in order, which it does not today.
2. **E2 — `plan_intent`** (question → validated intent), buildable against the `LLMProvider` interface with a fake, run against the fixture. `GET /catalog` gives the planner its vocabulary; the 422 body's `allowed` list lets it repair a bad intent instead of retrying blind. Needs no API key.
3. **A1 — CI running `make check` on PRs.** CI will need `msodbcsql18` + `unixodbc-dev` to build `pyodbc`. The suite is hermetic now (#48): it ignores `.env` and every `CORELANTIC_API_*` variable, so CI can set whatever it likes.
4. **#53 — accumulation vs display window. Fix before D6, not after.** A running total must start on its reset boundary, so D6's date-range control will 422 a "Revenue YTD" tile the moment the picked range doesn't start on 1 January.
5. **#52 — calendar spine.** `compare` uses `LAG`, which reads the previous *populated* bucket, so a fully empty week is skipped rather than shown as a drop to zero. Harmless on dense data; it bites the moment D5 cross-filters a weekly trend down to a low-volume channel.

Gated: spend/referrals registry (#37), NL agent wiring (E1), auth (O-4).

## Three traps waiting for the frontend

Read these before opening `apps/web`.

1. **A series' colour belongs to the entity, not to its position.** `--chart-1..8` in `apps/web/src/app/globals.css` are now eight validated hues in both modes (the five greys are gone). `ChartSpec.series[].palette_index` is the member's index in the registry's **declared `members`**, so cross-filtering a trend down to two channels leaves those two the colour they already were. Index the palette by array position instead and a filter silently repaints the survivors — the reader re-learns the legend without noticing.

   The consequence, which surprises people: **a dimension can only be pivoted if it declares a closed member list of ≤ 8.** Today that is `call_direction` (2) and `call_result` (7). `channel` declares **nine** members and `state` declares none, so neither can split a trend — `POST /query` answers `422 unpivotable_dimension`. Nominal bars are unaffected (`leads by channel` is one series, every bar in slot 1 — colouring bars by their value would spend the identity channel re-encoding what bar length already shows). Folding a ninth member into "Other" is the obvious fix and is **not** trivial: `channel` already has members literally named `Other`, `Unknown` and `Other Social Media`, so a synthesised bucket would collide with a real one and quietly change the numbers. It needs the registry to mark a residual member. Filed, not built.
2. **D4's KPI row asks for five tiles and three exist.** New leads, Voucher rate and Revenue are live. **Marketing Spend and ROAS are `marketing_budget`** (#37, Imran's). Either ship three and leave two gaps, or re-pick five from the 25 — the telephony and agent metrics are pure upside and nobody at KRW has seen them. A product call, not an engineering one.
3. **A KPI tile is one request, not two.** `POST /query` with `grain` + `compare` returns `period`, the value, `previous` and `delta` together, over one window. Do not fetch a metric and its delta separately; that was the old design and it could not guarantee both covered the same days.

"Recent intakes" (D5) is the one visual with no metric behind it — it wants raw rows, not an aggregate, and no endpoint returns those.

## Working agreements that paid off

- **Probe the database before authoring a metric.** Three definitions that looked obvious from column names were wrong by 4×, 1000×, and 2×. The probes cost minutes; the errors would have been invisible on a dashboard.
- **Run a codex architectural pass on every PR — and on the *plan*, before writing code.** Reviewing the plan for the semantic-API rework caught a sequencing bug (flipping `SemanticError` to 500 while a route still raised it from a path param) and a filtered-measure case we had missed, before either existed as a diff. Reviewing diffs has caught eight bugs that would have shipped silently: a Sunday-boundary week bucket in SQL Server, `LAG` reading across a NULL period, a registry constant shadowing a measure, a derived formula selecting an unaggregated literal, a dark-mode focus ring that vanished while a button was held down, a running total that started mid-period under the same label as an honest one, a derived metric that could declare itself additive while dividing by a measure, and — in the chart builder — a label-keyed pivot that silently dropped a bar when a NULL and a literal `"(Blank)"` shared a column, losing part of the total on a chart nobody would think to distrust. The fix (align by row position, never by display label) also caught that the offending dict was doing no work the row order didn't already carry.

  Redirect stdin or it hangs forever on `Reading additional input from stdin...`, and never pipe it through `tail` — `tail` buffers until the stream closes, so a hung run and a working one look identical:

  ```bash
  codex exec --sandbox read-only --skip-git-repo-check "$(cat prompt.txt)" < /dev/null > codex.log 2>&1
  ```

  Two shell traps around it: `pkill -f "codex exec"` matches the agent's own shell and kills the session — `kill` by PID. And a triple-backtick fence inside `$(cat <<'EOF')` unbalances bash's legacy backtick parsing, so `gh issue create --body-file` beats `--body "$(…)"`.
- **Compute the palette; never eyeball it.** The `dataviz` skill ships a validator, and it earns its keep immediately: `#0a9a24` reads as a clean green beside the yellow and scores **ΔE 1.4** under protanopia — the two collapse into one line. The eight hues were derived, not chosen: seed slot 1 with `--primary`, snap the three sub-3:1 hues darker *in-hue* against our own white card (not the reference's off-white surface), then enumerate all 5040 slot orderings and keep the one maximising the worst adjacent ΔE across **both** modes. Result: 4/4 checks pass in each mode, worst adjacent ΔE 23.5 / 23.7 against a target of 12. Two traps on the way: darkening the yellow for contrast collapsed green↔yellow to 9.4 until the order changed, and six of the eight dark-mode contrast ratios I first wrote from memory into the CSS comment were wrong. Measure, then write the number down.

- **Render the thing, not the object you meant to render.** ECharts draws to an SVG string in Node (`echarts.init(null, null, {ssr: true, renderer: "svg"})`), so the renderer is testable with no browser and no canvas. Asserting on the option object said the adapter was correct; actually drawing it said `grid.containLabel` is **deprecated and inert in ECharts 6** — the chart still drew, and merely clipped its own axis labels. A deprecated option is never an exception; it is a log line and a subtly wrong picture.

- **Probe with a value that changes behaviour.** The hermetic-tests fix (#48) looked complete under `.env`, which only sets `data_source=fixture` — something the tests tolerate. Exporting `CORELANTIC_API_SEMANTIC_DIR=/tmp/nope` turned 24 tests red and exposed a fixture-ordering bug (pytest builds module-scoped fixtures before function-scoped autouse ones). A probe that cannot fail proves nothing.

  It bit again immediately. The test guarding against deprecated ECharts options spied on `console` *inside* the test — but ECharts logs each deprecation once per process, and an earlier chart in the same file had already spent it, so the guard passed with `containLabel` restored. Moving the spy to `beforeAll`, ahead of the first draw, made it fail. **Re-introduce the bug and watch the test go red**, every time: three assertions in this PR (the palette-slot contract, the comparison hue, this one) were confirmed that way, and only one of the three was already correct.
- **Verify a claim numerically before building on it.** The whole intent-modifier redesign rested on "a ratio can be recomputed per bucket and then compared." That was checked against 185 weekly buckets of a hand-computed series *before* any code was written, and the check is now a test. The per-bucket mean (0.2414) differs from the whole-period ratio (0.2434) — which is the proof it is a genuine recomputation and not a reweighting, and the same mean-of-ratios trap [`data-model.md`](./data-model.md) records for `agent_stats`.
- **The test suite reads nothing from the machine.** `Settings` loads `.env` *and* every `CORELANTIC_API_*` variable, so tests inherited whatever a developer or CI runner had set: some failed for people who followed the setup docs, and the rest passed only because someone's file held the value they asserted. An autouse fixture strips both channels, with canary tests that fail loudly if it ever stops (#48).
- **The fixture mirrors the real schema.** One registry serves both, so a fixture test is a real test. Fixture reproduces the source: 86,973 leads, 38.3% no-geo, voucher rate 24.1%, answer rate 80.86%, agent conversion 4.44%.

## Running it locally

```bash
make install                 # both apps
make dev-api                 # API on :8080  (docs at /docs)
make dev-web                 # web on :3000
make client                  # regenerate the typed API client after API changes
make check                   # lint + typecheck + tests, both apps
make validate                # validate the semantic registry
```

Business API routes are **fail-closed**: set the same secret in both apps or they answer 503. In `apps/api/.env` set `CORELANTIC_API_INTERNAL_API_KEY`, and in `apps/web/.env.local` set `INTERNAL_API_KEY` to the same value. Copy each app's `.env.example` to start.

`CORELANTIC_API_DATA_SOURCE=fixture` needs nothing external. `=azure_sql` needs the ODBC driver, the VPN, and a device-code login on first read.
